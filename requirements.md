# Final project requirements

Final projects demonstrate your mastery of the material covered in class, as well as give the opportunity for you to continue to learn new skills.

Your final project must:

1. Consist of code written by you
2. Use at least Javascript, HTML, and CSS
3. Use other technologies we've covered in class (React, webpack, babel, express, node, npm) as appropriate
4. Use at least one other technology that wasn't covered directly in class
5. Connect to at least two APIs (e.g. firebase for data storage)
6. Code hosted on github, with reasonable commit history
7. Deployed and running on a cloud provider such as Heroku
8. Have a running (and passing) test suite (through Travis CI or similar) - at least two per page
9. Be of high quality, including code, comments, and documentation
10. Be relatively bug free
11. Be usable and functional
